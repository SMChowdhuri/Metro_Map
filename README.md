# Metro_Map
Metro_Map using c++

This is a simple C++ program that will take information of the source station and the destination station, of Metro, from the user and display the fare and shortest metro route to reach the destination. It will also have a metro map for commuterâ€™s better navigation.

The idea is implemented using Graph and Heap data structures. The graph has nodes and edges. Nodes represent a metro station containing certain information regarding that station, like its name, metro corridor, and the lines it connects. Edges (the connection between two nodes) represent the distance between the two stations and the cost of each edge will be equal to the distance between the two of its connecting stations(nodes).

By using different algorithms like Dijkstra, breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc, the shortest path between the source station and the destination station is determined, and accordingly, the distance is calculated based on the total distance between the two stations. Finally, the metro route between the two stations and the total time is displayed.
